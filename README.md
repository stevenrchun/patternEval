Good times

Not sure what timeframe you intended this to be done in, so I just did each question in bursts. First one took ~30 minutes, second: ~10 minutes, and the mockup ~2.5 hours. I decided to read up on Sass along the way, which was great and I love it, even though I wasn't sure how to properly access the collections. I just ended up splitting them into their own variables. Overall, tons of fun! Thanks!
